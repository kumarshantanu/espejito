# espejito

A Clojure library to find inter-layer latency in single-threaded processing.

## Usage

### Requiring namespace
```clojure
(:require [espejito.core :as e])
```

### Starting to monitor

Wrap your outer-most layer with the following call

```clojure
(e/report e/print-table
  ...) ; body of code
```

### Measure at every layer

```clojure
(e/measure "layer-name"
  ...) ; body of code to measure
```

The measure calls can be spread across several namespaces. Make sure that the layer-name is unique for every
measurement point.

## Caveats

This library assumes single-threaded code path only. For new/other threads you must use separate `report` for those
threads.
